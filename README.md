Hey this is a practice repository for "new-pythoners!" i just pasted all the highlighted you guys need to cover and look into to learn python and make sure you master it. Gave you the essential parts, you deal with the rest, you can paste every line or even file and see its outpout. i'm guiding you through a lot, incase you guys are running out of time, you can gain it back by seeing my code. seeing those seperated files and give it a try, you can practice using what i share with you all!
So bear in mind and change your mindset, you lean to make impact, to the whole world we are volenteers for the good deeds and we have to do so. Nothing is impossible, the peak has a room for everyone, thank you for reading. 

## rain()
being a little sarcastic, just make my code looks more "Pythonic" and gives a soul to my simple repository.
