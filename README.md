Hey, this is a pratical part of Harvard course (cs50).
i just paste all the highlighted you guys need to cover and look into to learn python, gave you the essential part, you deal with the rest, you can paste every line or even file and see its outpout. i'm guiding you through a lot, incase you guys are running out of time, you can gain it back by seeing my code. seeing those seperated files and give it a try, you can practice using what i share with you all!

So bear in mind that i'm giving you the the whole code that is presented in that course.
